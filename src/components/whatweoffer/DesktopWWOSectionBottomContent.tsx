        All classes uses a variety of child friendly tools such as cooking, arts & crafts, musical instruments, drama, songs and games.We currently run these sessions every holiday in various locations as well as in after-school clubs in many state and private schools across Dorset and Hampshire.“Our children who have attended the after-school Universal Mindfulness sessions have thrived. At school, we have noticed their self-confidence grow and their positive mental attitude has benefitted friendships as well as learning. I would highly recommend all children to attend these sessions. They are taught valuable life skills to help them manage change and cope with difficult situations through creative, fun and engaging activities.” Deputy Headteacher We also offer 1-1 consultations in Wimborne and Bournemouth for children or families.If you are interested in learning more about Universal Mindfulness for Children or offering our camps at your school, please Contact Us.If you’d like to book your child on to one of our holiday camps, please
